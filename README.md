# WiFlix
Wiflix is a cross-layer system with content-aware algorithms both at the upper application layaer as weel as lower MAC/PHY layers. The transmission scheduling and congestion control algorithms are amenable to a distributed implementation. Congestion control decisions are implemented at the app-layer of the streaming devices akin to DASH (dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP) and the decisons corresponding to scheduling devices for transmission are implemented independently at the MAC layer of the access points. Detailed results and simulation assumptions are described in : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.06856.pdf
